This mod gives you the "Dragon Rider" victory dance. This is done by creating and animating a fake entity that's triggered every time you win a game, giving you the victory dance without having to do the work of doing the challenges to get the ranked reward.


 - recommendatons
use a flying victory dance like "Snow Golem", "Chineese Dragon", Etc so you actually can fly with it
